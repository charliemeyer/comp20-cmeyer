This repository is a collection of my work for Tufts Comp20 Web Programming with Ming Chow, which I completed in Spring 2015. 

My favorite assignment has been the semster group project, as I've learned a lot about working with groups, templating, NodeJS and Heroku (I did our project's backend).

I've grown a lot with respect to my knowledge of web programming fundamentals since the beginning of the course. Prior to Comp20, I mainly hacked together code that I wrote for the web, without understanding the full picture. I feel like I now have the tools neccessary to contextualize new skills and web technologies I'll learn about in my private work. 

The most important thing I've learned about is to seperate my concerns when doing web development. For instance, on the semester project, I concerned myself with the backend while my group members did the frontend. Although some coordination was necessary to make it all work, I didn't have to worry about CSS while I was editing code that interacted with the database. This was also made clear in the transition between homeworks 2 and 3, when we switched from writing the Marauder's Map client and server. 

Now that the course is over, I really want to dive more into backend web development. NodeJS + Heroku is a great platform, and it's really easy for me to make a project and get it online with my skills from Comp20.
