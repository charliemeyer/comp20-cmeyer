  <h1 id="title">Bad Job Ming: Trusting User Input Gone Wrong</h1>
  <h3 id="name">By: Charles Meyer, April 2015</h3>
  <p id="quote">"Never trust user input. Never trust user input. Never trust user input. Never trust user input.
  Never trust user input. Never trust user input. Never trust user input. Never trust user input." -Ming Chow</p>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The purpose of this report is to find security flaws in Ming Chow's implementation of the server for the 
  Tufts' Marauder's Map, a version of which is located <a href="http://badjobming.herokuapp.com">here.</a> The app is intended to store the most recent latitude and longitude information ("checkins") of users, and display them back.</p>
  <h1>Methodology</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>I received a copy of Ming's server.js code and set it up on a new Heroku app, aptly named "badjobming",
  due to the numerous security holes in his code. I then used the Postman app for Chrome and the curl command line http client to carry out my attacks on the site. I also examined the server.js code for further issues.</p>
  <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The badjobming application is quite insecure.  It blindly accepts user input, stores it, and redisplays it to other users, making it vulnerable to several common attacks, which jeopardize the ability of users to access the information from the site, and may even put them in danger (see below under "Cross Site Scripting"). Furthermore, it allows for incorrect and spammy input to be posted on the site.</p> 
  <h1>Issues Found</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>Issue 1: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>Location:</h3><p>Invalid input is allowed on POST '/sendLocation', displayed on GET '/'.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Severity: High.</h3> <p>Malicious code can be executed on the client's machine. For instance, see the "Fakebook" login screen shot. If a more devious attacker worked to replicate the Facebook login perfectly, they could trick users of the badjobming app into giving away Facebook login info. I was also able to make alerts pop up, and if I could have manipulated the site in countless other ways had I wanted to. </p></li>
    <li><h3>Description:</h3><p>Input for the "login" field of the 'sendLocation' API is not validated. That is, I was able to type a script like <code>alert("Hacked by Charlie");</code> as the login parameter and have it execute every time the '/' webpage was rendered. I also was able to send arbitrary html which was rendered on the '/' page. That is how I was able to make a fake Facebook login, which by default opened the user's email client with a message to me with their username and password prefilled. (See screenshots).</p></li>
    <li><h3>Proof:</h3>
    <a href="screenshots/postman.png"><img src="screenshots/postman.png" alt="postman"></a>
    <a href="screenshots/alert.png"><img src="screenshots/alert.png" alt="alert"></a>
    <a href="screenshots/fakebook.png"><img src="screenshots/fakebook.png" alt="fakebook"></a>
    <a href="screenshots/composemail.png"><img src="screenshots/composemail.png" alt="compose email"></a>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Resolution:</h3><p>A simple solution to this problem would be to sanitize user input from the login parameter. The "Validator" module for Nodejs provides a function called "escape()" that does just that. In fact, the module is already imported into the server.js code. The escape function replaces special characters with their HTML equivalents, i.e. "&lt;" --&gt; "&amp;lt;"</p>
    <p>example code:</p>
    <code>loginToStore = validator.escape(request.body.login);</code></li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h2>Issue 2: No User Authentication</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>Location: POST '/sendLocation'</h3></li>
    <li><h3>Severity: Medium/High</h3><p>Although it could be considered a valid use of the web app, an attacker could post hundreds of messages under different user accounts at different locations, flooding the application with garbage data.  </li>
    <li><h3>Description:</h3><p>People sending their location to the application through the POST '/sendLocation' endpoint are not required to be a verified user. I was able to exploit this by running a shell script (included in the repo in the file "hack.sh") that used curl to programatically checkin at intervals of one latitude/longitude unit with the username "cmeyerIJ" where I and J were the latitude and the longitude posted with that username.</li>
    <li><h3>Proof:</h3><p> See the results of programmatic spamming of the site via my Homework 2 client hooked up to badjobming</p>
    <a href="screenshots/mmap.png"><img src="screenshots/mmap.png" alt="mmap"></a></li>
    <li><h3>Resolution:</h3><p>Implementing some sort of login system would prevent this kind of attack. This would slow down an attacker, as creating an account takes time and if implemented correctly, would require the existence of a unique email address and would require some verification of users' humanity (i.e. through a CAPTCHA). If possible, the system would be able to reject repeated inputs from the same IP address in the event that a single attacker was able to make many accounts. A simple alternative to fully implementing user accounts would be to check logins against a whitelist of real users. This would stop users from outside of the verified users list from posting, and would prevent situations like the one I created where the database fills up with garbage input (as only the newest checkin for a given user is stored/displayed) </p>
    <p>example code:</p>
    <code>if (login in whitelist) {...accept input...} else {..reject input...}</code></li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h2>Issue 3: Database Query Injection</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>Location: GET '/location.json'</h3></li>
    <li><h3>Severity: medium</h3><p>I was able to access the location.json endpoint in an unintended manner, using MongoDB database queries instead of regular strings. If used by someone more clever, the problem could be quite severe!</p></li>
    <li><h3>Description:</h3><p> The input for the GET query to the location.json endpoint is not validated. That is, sending the query 'location[$ne]=cmeyer' was valid, and returned the first database entry not matching the username cmeyer. Luckily, the server.js file calls 'findOne' on the database, otherwise my injection would have returned ALL data with a username not matching 'cmeyer'. Also fortunately, this database injection style attack was only possible to my knowledge on this get endpoint. A more serious vulnerability would have been one that would have let me make arbitrary commands to the database, not just make special queries. For instance, if I had been able to make arbitrary commands, I could have sent a query that would have cleared the database. </p></li>
    <li><h3>Proof:</h3>
      <a href="screenshots/injection.png"><img src="screenshots/injection.png" alt="query injection"></a></li>
    <li><h3>Resolution:</h3>
        <p>Again, sanitizing the user's input would have prevented this kind of attack. Using the same code from the validator module as was suggested in the XSS vulnerability description would have thwarted this attack.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Clearly, the lesson here is that Ming should have NEVER trusted user input. At low cost, he could have sanitized user input before storing it in his database and sending it back to be displayed on the client. Although implementing user authentication would have been time consuming, checking submitted logins against a simple white-list would have protected against the most egregious hacks of the site at again, low cost.</p>
