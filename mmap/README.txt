Comp20 Assignment 2 (mmap) README
By: Charles Meyer
March 2015

To the best of my knowledge, everything is implemented correctly for this
assignment. 

I collaborated with Elias Jarzombek on this assignment.

I also referenced code from the Stackoverflow post linked in the 
assignment for computing distances between points using the
Haversine Formula, as well as the example code for Google Maps API
usage in the class Github.

I spent ~3 hours completing the assignment.
